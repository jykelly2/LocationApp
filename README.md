# LocationApp (Individual App)
LocationApp (Still in progress of development) allows users to search for any places along user's traced path. Core Location tracks and traces user's path on the map which are used in the search. The user can click on the map annotation or the item in the TableView to get more information about the place such as phone number, website and time. Using Firestore, user's account, saved places, recent searches and place history are saved in the cloud database. User can also manually create an account or sign up with their existing social media account using Facebook login or Google sign in API (Apple sign in will be implemented when I will submit this app to AppStore).

This app is innovative and unique since there is no exising application to have search ability using user's traced path. So far Apple and Google maps have only have the ability to search for places from point A to B in the navigation and are restricted within certain distance range.
