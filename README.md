# LocationApp - Individual App(Still in progress of development)
LocationApp allows users to search for any places along user's traced path. Core Location tracks and traces user's path on the map which are used in the search. The user can click on the map annotation or the item in the TableView to get more information about the place such as phone number, website and time. Using Firestore, user's account, saved places, recent searches and place history would be saved in the cloud database. 

User can also manually create an account or sign up with their existing social media account using Facebook login or Google sign in API. Apple sign in has not been implemented yet as it will cost money to upgrade Apple's developer account. (will be implemented when I will submit this app to AppStore)

This app is innovative and unique since no application are out in the market to have search ability using user's traced path. So far Apple and Google maps have only the ability to search for places from point A to B in the map's navigation and are restricted within certain distance range.
